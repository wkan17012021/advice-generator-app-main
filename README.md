## Overview

This is a great mini project for consuming API data if you don't have experience with APIs. It still requires background reading on the subject to understand how the app and the Advice Slip JSON API are communicating. Depending on your prior knowledge and time available, CodeCademy's lessons on JSON, APIs, requests fundamentals are a good place to start. They form part of the front eng. career path.

This was a milestone in my learning because previously, all my independent projects including ones on my portfolio are static so this opens up doors for more creative and functional applications. It took many hours of high level understanding, then actually practical coding and finally testing what I have learned in order to complete this FEM proj. I'm aware this is a basic use of an API, but hats off to FEM for making the learning on this subject smooth as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

- I did substantial research around the topic before attempting this challenge as it is a step-up from the previous html/css challenges. This made the process smoother than if I had just winged it using google searches.
- Used vanilla css/js (the focus was on the API) for this one.
- Base knowledge on fetching and consuming API data (CodeCademy, see above). Also, I referred to my own notes I have compiled since starting out learning to code, where I had forgotten concepts.

### Built with

- Used previous FEM proj for boilerplate html/css card component and reset css code
- Semantic HTML5 markup (implemented accessible features and linting)
- CSS native (gave me an excuse to research vendor prefixes and implement linting)
- Flexbox (main card component)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This proj took about 3hours solid coding / staring at the screen, the majority of the time consumed on getting the quote data to render on the screen properly (trial and error) plus time spent on styling tweaks (trial and error). I learned about accessing a basic API, observing the output as JSON / JS obj, how to convert and manipulate it into the application.

It helped that the API didn't require any sign up or a token. The docs were satisfactorily informative which meant learning how to implement the API was straightforward.

### Continued development

Keep practicing with consuming APIs in more creative ways within the app. Try implementing with an API requiring authentication / authorisation.

### Useful resources

- [Lesson #19: Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path) - This helped me to grasp the fundamentals on APIs and ES6 / ES8 methods for dealing with promises. It has a number of worked examples for getting data and how to manipulate that data in your project.
- [Accessibility Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) - I haven't been doing enough learning on A11y so this was a good excuse to invest time into it. The article is useful for checking against best practice.
- HTML, CSS and JS linters - google search and make revisions by providing your source code.
